      <p>The Elder is known for their production of Pinot Noir and award-winning olive oil from Martinborough.
        <br>
        <br>
        The task was to design the logo and packaging for a new olive oil product that would go alongside their already existing Blue Earth olive oil range. This new product had an intended target audience of 25 to 35-year-olds with a preference for premium NZ-made products.
        <br>
        <br>
        The name was derived from a specific parameter used to analyse the quality of olive oil.
        Olive oil must have an acidity level equal to or below 0.8% to be considered extra virgin olive oil, or EVOO. The acidity of olive oil does not refer to its taste but to the amount of fatty acids it contains. Generally, the lower the acidity level, the greater the quality of the olive oil.
        Point Eight served as an indicator of the brand’s premium status.
        <br>
        <br>
        The logo was inspired by the natural and organic shapes of the olive fruit, while the colour scheme was influenced by the delicate hues of an olive branch.
        The result was a brand that catered to young millennials wanting to buy local products and a product with an appealing high-end aesthetic due to the minimal colour palette and restrained typography.
