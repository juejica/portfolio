        Jojo Rabbit is a comedy-drama war film about Johannes “Jojo” Betzler, a ten-year-old Hitler Youth member who finds out that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic. 
        His nickname became “Jojo Rabbit” after failing to strangle a bunny when ordered to do so at a Nazi youth training camp.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the movie was portrayed from the perspective of a 10-year-old, I aimed to capture the innocent and whimsical nature of Jojo’s imagination.
        <br>
        <br>
        Frames were drawn frame-by-frame in Procreate and brought into After Effects for compositing and transitions.
